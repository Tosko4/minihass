<p>Hi and welcome to MiniHass MKII, my second version of this minimalistic, rounded and colorful dashboard UI for Home Assistant.</p>
<h2>Theme</h2>
<p>This dashboard is dependent on the correct theme to utilize its full potential, including light and dark modes.</p>
<h2>Included cards</h2>
<p>I will keep adding new card gradually. For now, these are the available card templates you can copy and use:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Coffee</li>
  <li>Tea</li>
  <li>Milk</li>
</ul>
